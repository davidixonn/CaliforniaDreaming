## Project Description/Outline

Our project proposes to examine what factors might affect one's decision to move to California from out of state. Aside from the standard answer that people move to California because of the weather, we look at demographics, cost of housing, and employment opportunities.

## Research Questions to Answer

* What are the most densely populated counties in California?
* Where in California do we see the most growth?
* How does population compare regionally from the coastal counties to the inland counties?
* How is the cost of housing changing in California?
* How much does it cost to live in a coastal county vs. an inland county?
* How much do rents vary in northern, central, and southern counties in California?
* Is there a relationship between changing rents and changing population?
* Where are employment opporunities increasing in California?
* In what industries are most employment opportunities in California?
