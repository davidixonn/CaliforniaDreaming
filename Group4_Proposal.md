## Project Description/Outline

Our project proposes to examine the relationship between the cost of housing and the poverty level by region in the United States. How does the increasing cost of housing/gentrification in an area affect the movement of people across regions, and the number of people who are categorized as below the poverty level?

## Research Questions to Answer

* What impact does the cost of housing have on the poverty level in different regions of the United States (California)?
* How does gentrification and the cost of housing affect where people of different income levels move to?
* What is the relationship between rental vacancies and the cost of housing?
* How does consumer spending affect the cost of housing and the poverty level?
* In regions with higher consumer spending, does education level have an impact on what people spend on housing?
* In a general sense, are the numbers of people below the poverty level increasing or decreasing?
* Trends in Income?
* Where is the greatest population growth in California?
* Is the population growth in an area related to the weather?

* Median Income vs. Cost of Housing
* Cost of Living
* Unemployment vs. Job opportunities
* Weather
* Education Opportunities? Cost of Education?
* Cost of commuting/transportation?
* Number of Restaurants/Diversity of Restaurants
* Economic Opportunities
